## Notes

- All raw data (Kaggle datasets) are kept unchanged; transformations and preprocessing are handled in the Jupyter notebooks.
- Synthetic data is created to simulate ESG metrics and compliance, allowing integrated analysis with fraud transactions.
- The structure and naming conventions are designed to simplify linking with Power BI and the API endpoints.
